Function NPCLoot is what runs when an NPC is killed.

Wondering if I can equip/give something to the player that stores everything from the mod in an unrechable spot.

Got the xp formula working with a cheesy display over enemy heads when they are killed.
Need to apply the logic to the function that checks when an NPC is hit by something.

The atribute system is going to be an absolute nightmare to implement, so I'll do levels only.

I think I got the damage boost working out with the levels, gonna test later.

Everything's working when it comes to damage going up with the level, found the PostUpdate() function and that is going to be just the thing that I needed to boost the player's hp, mana and defense with the level.

Hp and mana boosted correctly, defense buffing is iffy if a debuff happens to be present. Now I need to add the xp and level to somewhere on the inventory screen and the mod is ready to be shipped.

Need to do some hard work on cleaning up the code, "XPToNextLevel" -> "GetLevelupXP" plus uppercase everything. Change doubles to float and hopefully don't break everything.
jorfaiden's better code for level up https://hastebin.com/ikamewotat.cs also "return TryLevelUp();"
I'm going to change it so the level can be calculated directly instead of by iterations.

My game has been struggling hard while flushing large amounts of fluid when building hellevators, assumed it was my mod's fault and went about doing what I believe will improve performance.

Time to rethink the buffs on this thing and add some configuration.
Scrapped most buffs, felt things were a nightmare to keep track of, plus some redundant stuff like damage reduction being effectively the same as more hp.
Idk why it got in me to add checks to make sure stuff stays within the caps, but that is there now.
It's working and idk if I'm updating this again.
