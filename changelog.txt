Icon has a slight border now.
Mod description changed.
The cap for xp required to level up has been increased to 500 million, it'll cap around level 120 now.
Level now capped at 1000.
Internal handling of the damage and hp buffs changed. They now have a 0.1% step and a multiplier that can be set by the player with the new command.

Added the /simpleSetMultiplierDamageHP command. This allows the player to set on the fly how discrete or how strong the buffs are. Default values are 20 and 10, which result in +2% damage and +1% hp per level.
Yes this command is gigantic and used to set both at the same time, each one caps at 1000, setting a value bigger than that will leave it unchanged.
Setting any to 0 turns off the respective buff.

Removed most buffs, only hp and damage remain.
Removed the /simple command.

Because of the 400 mana cap, mana per level has been lowered to 2
Buffing each damage type individually seems to have hit a cap, so it was returned to the old formula.
